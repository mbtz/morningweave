**Closing current task and preparing next steps**
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'tk close sc-0398' in /Users/marius/jobb/some-curator succeeded in 52ms:
Updated sc-0398 -> closed

thinking
**Verifying PRD task coverage**

I confirmed existing tasks cover most PRD features, with minor uncertainties like explicit platform disablement and no-scraping policy, though those may be implicitly handled. No clear missing tasks detected; next I'll check changed files with a git status summary.

thinking
**Summarizing final steps and usage instructions**

The repo has no initial commit but the .tickets file is updated as expected and no user feedback was found. I'll explain that tasks are done per the issue-tracking and workflow pattern used, note the PRD is unchanged, and provide instructions for running the CLI with `PYTHONPATH=src python -m morningweave --help` or via `pip install -e .`. I'll mention the current src layout and why `python -m morningweave` requires setting PYTHONPATH or installation, without adding extra packaging now. Finally, I'll note that no tests beyond the help command have been added.

**Crafting final update summary**

I'm preparing a clear final response outlining that issue sc-0398 was started and closed with no USER_FEEDBACK found, and the PRD remains unchanged. I'll explain the addition of a Python CLI scaffold using argparse and entry points, referencing key files. I'll note the tested help command and close the single task, then suggest next steps like implementing an init command and adding a config loader, formatted with a brief "Update" header and bullet points.
codex
Using skills: issue-tracking → workflow-pattern.

Added a Python CLI scaffold with argparse and entry points, covering every command from the PRD with placeholder handlers and basic argument parsing so the command surface is ready for real logic. Files: `pyproject.toml`, `src/morningweave/cli.py`, `src/morningweave/__main__.py`, `src/morningweave/__init__.py`.

- Task status: `sc-0398` started and closed.
- USER_FEEDBACK.md: not found, so no feedback tasks created.
- PRD.md: no edits needed.

Tested: `PYTHONPATH=src python -m morningweave --help`

Next steps (pick one):
1) Implement `init` + config schema/validation (`sc-deee`, `sc-7dd2`).
2) Implement config loader (`sc-e685`) so commands can read `config.yaml`.
