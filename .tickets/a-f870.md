# Add auth requirement hints for missing platform credentials

When status/run detects missing credentials or parse/resolve failures, append the connector's auth requirements (scopes + notes) so warnings are actionable.

Acceptance:
- status warnings for enabled platforms include scopes/notes when credentials are missing.
- run warnings include the same hints for missing/invalid credentials.
- HN/auth-free platforms do not emit auth requirement hints.
