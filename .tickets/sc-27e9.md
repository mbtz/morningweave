# Spec: Digest email rendering & delivery

Check HTML digest sizing, item counts, provider support, and empty-run handling per PRD.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Digest selects 5-10 top items overall and respects 300-350 word cap.
- HTML output is mobile-friendly, light on images, and uses the configured subject template.
- Items include title, 1-2 sentence excerpt, merged source links, and platform badges.
- Resend is first-class; SMTP fallback works (incl. Outlook); `test-email` sends a sample.
- Empty runs skip email and record as empty status.
