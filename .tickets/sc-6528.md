# Spec: CLI surface & UX parity

Confirm CLI commands, flags, and outputs align with PRD; update help/docs as needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Go CLI preserves existing Python scaffolding behavior for `init`, `add-platform`, `set-tags`, and `set-category`.
- Commands match PRD list (init/add-platform/set-tags/set-category/run/start/stop/status/logs/test-email/auth set|get|clear).
- `init` generates `config.yaml`, `USER_TODO.md`, and the SQLite datastore under `data/` and prompts for email provider.
- `status` shows enabled platforms, next runs, and last run result; `logs` supports `--since` and `--json`.
- Help text and errors include actionable guidance for missing config/secrets and unavailable platform access.
