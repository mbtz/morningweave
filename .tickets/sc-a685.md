# Verify USER_FEEDBACK go test failures

Re-run go test ./... and confirm the USER_FEEDBACK build/test failures (reddit connector compile errors, ranking tokenize collision, email render unused variable, dedupe canonicalize default ports, storage NULL scan handling, X connector tests) no longer reproduce. If they do, fix and update tests.
