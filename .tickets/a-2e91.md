# PRD v1 end-to-end verification

Run a full cycle on macOS and a home server with at least one platform enabled per PRD (Reddit/X/Instagram/HN where keys exist). Capture timings (<60s target), memory (<200MB), warnings, and validate digest word cap + item count. Record results in docs/prd-acceptance.md.
