# Streamline platform auth setup flow

Reduce manual steps for enabling platforms. Extend add-platform (and/or new auth set --interactive) to prompt for required credential fields, validate, and store in keychain/1Password when selected. Include clear guidance for 1Password refs so users are not editing config by hand.

Acceptance:
- add-platform can guide through credential entry (incl. X bearer token) without manual config edits.
- When 1Password is chosen, write an `op://...` ref into config and confirm the field key (x-api-key or x-ap-key).
- For keychain/secrets, store and set `credentials_ref` automatically.
