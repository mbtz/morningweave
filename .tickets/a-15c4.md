# Fix 1Password op:// refs and bearer token parsing

Allow secrets resolver to accept op://... references directly (without requiring op: prefix). Update X credential parsing to accept 'Bearer <token>' values from 1Password/Keychain. Add tests for resolver ref parsing and ParseCredentials with Bearer prefix.
