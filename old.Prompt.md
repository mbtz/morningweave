We are starting the process of specifying the app 'MorningWeave'.

Read PRD.md and understand the goals for this product. This will be its specification.

Use the `issue-tracking` skill for creating tasks and managing them based on the spec in PRD.md. Write very actionable and clear tasks and description.

If you need something done by the user, add it to USER_TODO.md. This especially for things you need or want to get access to, or final tests needing to be run.

Feedback from TODOs and other improvements will be in USER_FEEDBACK.md. Read that and update or create any related tasks based on the feedback. The user has final say.

Before closing a completed task, commit it to git. Make sure you close tasks after completion. When all tasks in an EPIC is done, consider if any new taks is needed or close the EPIC task as well.

Implement tasks.
